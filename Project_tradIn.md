# Project TradIn

**OBJECTIVE:** To connect a market having difficulty accessing people who can provide quality service for them in a given location with people who have skills and can provide quality service but are unable to find a market for their services in the same location.

## Problems

1. **UNEMPLOYMENT:** There are millions of Nigerians with technical skills needed day-to-day, including graphics design, writing, programming, other casual works (such as driving, cleaning e.t.c) but still remain largely unemployed or under-employed.

2. **ARTISAN TO PEOPLE RELATIONSHIP:** There has been a problem connecting artisans to people in need of their services within a defined location. There are also people who need their services within their locality and are constantly looking for someone to fill these roles.

3. **IMMOBILITY OF LABOUR:** Artisians or workers rendering services are mostly restricted to the areas where they are known in order to get jobs which leads to rigidity in labour. They have to get acquainted with new areas when they move out of an area to another area.

4. **CRUDE SERVICE:** Some artisans or workers fail to give quality service to their customers most times because they do not have the skills and tools required to render quality service.

**CASE STUDY:** Uncle Segun's car broke down on a road in an area he is not used to and he is stuck because he does not know any auto mechanic shop in that locality. His only option is to call his mechanic who is 28km away. Meanwhile some blocks away from him, Uncle Joe, a mechanic, is waiting for his distant client (25km away) to call him to pick up his car for servicing.

## Proposed Solution

**IMPROVED ARTISAN TO PEOPLE RELATIONSHIP:** We propose a solution that would get people the needed service they need in the **fastest time possible** and also a platform that would help to **eradicate incompetence and procrastination** on the part of the artisans which has always been a subject of debate for quite a long time.

**MOBILITY OF LABOUR**: Artisians and workers are not restricted to any geographical area they can get work even on the go.

**EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES:** Entrepreneurial studies and relevant skills acquisition would be on the rise when the populace see artisans doing good in society.

**BETTER SERVICE:** Artisians would be sure to have or learn relevant skills and offer quality service because they need to stay relevant and offer quality to stay in the trade and there is a review system for feedbacks.

**BETTER TRADING:** People can showcase their products to a large population of people (primary people within the same location) because the use of shops most times are restricted to the defined locality (early startups mainly) thereby bringing about ease for consumers.

There is always a job for everyone willing to do something thereby giving equity to everyone.

**CASE STUDY (continued):** Uncle Segun launched TradIn app to see if there is any mechanic in the area. The result included Uncle Joe, with a 4.8/5 rating from 27 feedbacks, he proceeds to place a request and call in the application. In 2 minutes Uncle Joe located Uncle Segun and fixed his car skillfully.
